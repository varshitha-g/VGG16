## VGG
VGG16 is a convolutional neural network architecture named after the Visual Geometry Group from Oxford, who developed it. It was used to win the ILSVRC2014 (Large Scale Visual Recognition Challenge 2014)) competition in 2014. It still considered to be an excellent vision model.

VGG-16 consists of 16 layers deep. The model loads a set of weights pre-trained on ImageNet. The model achieves 92.7% top-5 test accuracy in ImageNet, which is a dataset of over 14 million images belonging to 1000 classes.
