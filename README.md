## Overview

The VGG16 Image Classification project demonstrates the application of the VGG16 architecture, a 16-layer CNN, to classify images. This project showcases transfer learning by utilizing pre-trained weights, which allows for effective feature extraction and improved accuracy with limited training data.

## Dataset

Source: The dataset used can vary depending on your application (e.g., CIFAR-10, ImageNet, custom dataset).

Preprocessing: Images are resized to 224x224 pixels, normalized, and preprocessed to match the input requirements of VGG16.

## Model Architecture

VGG16: This 16-layer deep learning model is known for its simplicity and effectiveness in image classification. Key components include:

Multiple convolutional layers followed by max-pooling layers

Fully connected dense layers at the end for classification

Softmax activation for multiclass prediction

## Technologies Used

Python: Core programming language for building and training the model.

TensorFlow & Keras: For implementing the VGG16 model and managing the training pipeline.

NumPy & Pandas: For data manipulation and analysis.

OpenCV: For image processing tasks.
